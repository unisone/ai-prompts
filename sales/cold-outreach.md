# Cold Outreach Framework

> Write cold emails and LinkedIn messages that get responses.

## When to Use

- Email outreach campaigns
- LinkedIn prospecting
- Follow-up sequences
- Personalization at scale

## Why It Works

Cold outreach fails because it's about the sender, not the recipient. This framework flips the script: lead with their world, connect through relevance, and make responding easy.

## The Prompt

### Cold Email Generator

```
Write a cold email for:

**Sender**: [Your name/company]
**Product/Service**: [What you're selling]
**Target**: [Their role] at [Their company type]
**Trigger/Context**: [Why reaching out now - news, event, pain point]

Requirements:
- Subject line under 40 characters (no clickbait)
- First line about THEM, not you
- Under 100 words total
- One clear, low-commitment CTA
- No buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "solution")
- Sound like a human, not a sales robot

Generate 3 variations:
1. Direct approach (straight to value)
2. Curiosity approach (question-led)
3. Social proof approach (results-led)
```

### Personalization Framework

```
I need to personalize cold outreach to [PERSONA] at [COMPANY TYPE].

Research dimensions to personalize on:
1. **Company signals** - Recent news, funding, hiring, launches
2. **Personal signals** - Posts, content, career moves
3. **Industry signals** - Market trends, competitor moves
4. **Mutual connections** - Shared contacts, communities
5. **Tech stack** - Tools they use that relate to ours

For each dimension, give me:
- Where to find this info
- Example of how to mention it naturally
- What NOT to do (comes off as stalker-ish)
```

## Example

### Bad vs. Good Cold Email

**❌ BAD (What most people send):**
```
Subject: Partnership Opportunity

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from [Company]. We're a leading provider 
of [solution] that helps companies like yours achieve 
[benefit]. 

Our platform offers:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2  
- Feature 3

I'd love to schedule 15 minutes to discuss how we can 
help [Company] with their [vague goal].

Best,
[Sender]
```

**✅ GOOD:**
```
Subject: saw your post on AI agents

[Name] - your take on AI coding assistants being 
overhyped was spot on. The "works 80% of the time" 
problem is real.

We built [product] specifically for that last 20% - 
the edge cases where AI agents fall flat.

Worth a look? [one-click demo link]

— [First name]
```

### Follow-Up Sequence

```
Create a 4-email follow-up sequence for [PRODUCT/TARGET]:

**Email 1** (Day 0): Initial outreach
**Email 2** (Day 3): New angle/value prop
**Email 3** (Day 7): Social proof/case study
**Email 4** (Day 14): Breakup email

Rules:
- Each email under 80 words
- Different hook each time
- Never guilt-trip or be passive-aggressive
- Make it easy to say no (paradoxically increases yes)
```

### LinkedIn Message Templates

```
Write LinkedIn connection request messages for [GOAL]:

Constraints:
- Under 300 characters (LinkedIn limit)
- No "I'd love to pick your brain"
- No "I noticed we share connections"
- Specific reason for connecting
- No pitch in connection request

Then write the follow-up message for after they connect:
- Grateful but not sycophantic
- Provides value before asking
- Clear, low-commitment next step
```

## The "Problem-Agitate-Solve" Email

```
Write a cold email using Problem-Agitate-Solve:

**Target**: [Persona]
**Problem**: [Pain point they have]
**Product**: [Your solution]

Structure:
1. PROBLEM: Name their pain in their words (1 sentence)
2. AGITATE: Show you understand the implications (1-2 sentences)
3. SOLVE: Introduce your solution with proof (1 sentence)
4. CTA: Easy next step (1 sentence)

Total: 4-5 sentences max.
```

## Subject Line Generator

```
Generate 10 subject lines for cold email to [PERSONA] about [PRODUCT]:

Categories:
- Question-based (2)
- Curiosity-based (2)  
- Personalized reference (2)
- Number/stat-based (2)
- Direct/clear (2)

Rules:
- Under 40 characters
- No ALL CAPS
- No excessive punctuation!!!
- No "Quick question" (overused)
- No "Re:" faking (deceptive)

Then rank them by predicted open rate and explain why.
```

## Response Rate Optimizer

```
Here's my cold email that's getting low response rates:

[PASTE EMAIL]

Diagnose the problems:

**Subject line issues**:
**First line issues**:
**Length issues**:
**CTA issues**:
**Tone issues**:

Then rewrite it with your improvements.
```

## Pro Tips

1. **One idea per email** — Multiple CTAs = no action
2. **Write at 5th grade level** — Busy people skim
3. **Make it about them** — 80% their world, 20% your solution
4. **Give an out** — "No worries if not" increases replies
5. **Send when they're working** — Tuesday-Thursday, 9am or 2pm

## What to Avoid

| Don't | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| "I hope this finds you well" | Jump straight to relevance |
| "Just following up" | Add new value |
| Long paragraphs | 2-3 sentences max |
| Multiple questions | One clear CTA |
| "Best regards" formality | Match their vibe |
| Attachments | Link instead |

## Effectiveness

| Use Case | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Initial outreach | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Follow-up sequences | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| LinkedIn messages | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Subject lines | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
