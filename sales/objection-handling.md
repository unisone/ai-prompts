# Objection Handling Framework

> Turn "no" into "tell me more" with proven objection handling techniques.

## When to Use

- Preparing for common objections
- Real-time help during sales conversations
- Training sales teams
- Creating battle cards

## Why It Works

Most objections are predictable. By preparing responses that acknowledge, explore, and reframe objections, you turn resistance into conversation. The key is never being defensive — objections mean they're engaged.

## The Prompt

### Generate Objection Responses

```
I sell [PRODUCT/SERVICE] to [TARGET CUSTOMER].

Generate responses for these common objections:

For each objection:
1. **Acknowledge** - Validate their concern (never dismiss)
2. **Explore** - Ask a question to understand the real issue
3. **Reframe** - Provide perspective that addresses the concern
4. **Evidence** - Share proof (customer story, data, guarantee)
5. **Advance** - Move the conversation forward

OBJECTIONS:
- "It's too expensive"
- "We're happy with our current solution"
- "Now isn't a good time"
- "I need to think about it"
- "Send me more information"
- [ADD YOUR SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS]
```

### The Feel-Felt-Found Pattern

```
Create Feel-Felt-Found responses for selling [PRODUCT] to [PERSONA]:

Objection: "[OBJECTION]"

Response pattern:
- "I understand how you FEEL..."
- "Other [similar customers] FELT the same way..."
- "What they FOUND was..."

Make it genuine, not scripted-sounding. Include a specific customer example if possible.
```

## Example

### "It's Too Expensive"

```
Objection: "Your solution is too expensive for us."

**Acknowledge**: "I hear you — budget is always a real consideration, and I want to make sure this makes financial sense for you."

**Explore**: "When you say too expensive, help me understand — is it that the price is higher than you expected, higher than alternatives you're looking at, or outside your available budget for this quarter?"

**Reframe (based on answer)**:

If higher than expected:
"That's fair. Most people expect a lower price until they see what's included. Can I walk you through what you're actually getting and you can tell me which parts don't seem valuable?"

If higher than competitors:
"We're not the cheapest option, that's true. Can I ask — what would it cost your team if you went with a cheaper solution that didn't fully solve the problem? What's the cost of doing this twice?"

If budget constraints:
"Got it, that's a real constraint. A few options: we have payment terms that spread the cost, a smaller starter package, or we could look at which features you need now vs. later. What would make this workable?"

**Evidence**: "For context, [Similar Company] had the same concern. They ran the numbers and found that the time saved paid for the tool in 3 months. Want me to connect you with them?"

**Advance**: "What would help you feel confident this is worth the investment?"
```

### "We're Happy With Our Current Solution"

```
Objection: "We already have something that works."

**Acknowledge**: "That's great — if it's genuinely working, you shouldn't change. I'm not here to fix what isn't broken."

**Explore**: "Can I ask — when you say it's working, does that mean it's doing everything you need, or that it's good enough and switching would be a hassle?"

**Reframe**: "Most of our customers weren't unhappy with their old solution. They just didn't know what they were missing until they saw [key differentiator]. What would change your mind from 'good enough' to 'this is exactly what we need'?"

**Evidence**: "[Company] was in the exact same situation. They weren't unhappy. But after switching, their [metric] improved by [X%]. They told me they didn't realize how much friction they'd been living with."

**Advance**: "I'm not asking you to switch today. But would you be open to a 15-minute demo just to see if there's anything you're missing? If not, no hard feelings."
```

## Objection Categories

```

## Battle Card Generator

```
Create a sales battle card for handling objections to [PRODUCT]:

Format for each objection:
---
OBJECTION: "[What they say]"
TRANSLATION: [What they really mean]
RED FLAG?: [Is this a real concern or a brush-off?]
RESPONSE: [2-3 sentence response]
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION: [Keep conversation going]
PROOF POINT: [Evidence to share]
---

Include top 10 objections for this product category.
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Welcome objections** — They mean engagement, not rejection
2. **Never argue** — Acknowledge first, always
3. **Ask before answering** — Understand the real objection
4. **Use stories over stats** — "Customer X had the same concern..."
5. **Know when to walk away** — Not every objection can be overcome

## The "That's Exactly Why" Technique

```
Turn objections into reasons to buy:

Objection: "We're too small for this"
Response: "That's exactly why this makes sense — [product] was built so small teams can have enterprise-level [capability] without the enterprise-level price or complexity."

Generate "That's Exactly Why" responses for:
- [Objection 1]
- [Objection 2]
- [Objection 3]
```
