# Discovery Call Framework

> Structure sales discovery conversations to qualify leads and uncover real pain points.

## When to Use

- Preparing for sales calls
- Training on discovery methodology
- Creating call scripts
- Analyzing past calls for improvement

## Why It Works

Great discovery isn't about pitching — it's about understanding. This framework uses proven methodologies (SPIN, MEDDIC, Sandler) to uncover pain, impact, and buying process before you ever talk solutions.

## The Prompt

### Discovery Call Prep

```
I have a discovery call with [COMPANY/PERSON] about [PRODUCT/SERVICE].

Help me prepare:

**1. Pre-Call Research**
- What should I learn about them before the call?
- What trigger events might have caused them to take the call?
- What are likely pain points for their role/industry?

**2. Opening Questions** (rapport + context)
- 3 questions to understand their current situation
- How to transition from small talk to business

**3. Pain Discovery Questions** (SPIN framework)
- Situation: What's their current state?
- Problem: What's not working?
- Implication: What does that cost them?
- Need-Payoff: What would solving this mean?

**4. Qualification Questions** (MEDDIC)
- Metrics: How will they measure success?
- Economic Buyer: Who controls budget?
- Decision Criteria: What matters most?
- Decision Process: What are the steps?
- Identify Pain: Confirmed pain point
- Champion: Who's our internal advocate?

**5. Next Steps**
- How to close the call with clear action items

Give me specific questions I can ask, not generic categories.
```

### Analyze a Discovery Call

```
Here's a transcript/summary of my discovery call:

[PASTE CALL NOTES]

Analyze this call:

**Pain Points Identified**
- What problems did they mention?
- Which are explicit vs. implicit?
- Rate severity (1-10) for each

**Qualification Status**
- Budget: Confirmed? Amount?
- Authority: Talking to decision maker?
- Need: Is the pain urgent?
- Timeline: When do they need to act?

**What I Learned**
- About their process
- About their priorities
- About their objections

**What I Missed**
- Questions I should have asked
- Topics I should have explored deeper
- Red flags I may have ignored

**Recommended Next Steps**
- What should happen next?
- What follow-up should I send?
- Are they worth pursuing?
```

## Example

### SaaS Sales Prep

```
I have a discovery call with the VP of Engineering at a 50-person startup about our CI/CD platform.

Create my discovery framework:

OPENING (2 min)
- Rapport builder related to their company
- Transition question to business

CURRENT STATE (5 min)
- What's your current deployment process?
- How often do you deploy?
- What tools are you using today?

PAIN DISCOVERY (10 min)
- What's the most frustrating part of your current setup?
- Tell me about the last time a deployment went wrong
- How much time does your team spend on CI/CD maintenance?
- What happens when there's a production incident?

IMPACT (5 min)
- What does deployment downtime cost you?
- How does this affect your team's velocity/morale?
- What could you ship if you got this time back?

DECISION PROCESS (5 min)
- Who else would be involved in a decision like this?
- What's your evaluation process for new tools?
- What would make this a priority vs. something for later?

CLOSE (3 min)
- Summary of what I heard
- Proposed next step
- Timeline check
```

## SPIN Question Bank

```
Generate SPIN questions for selling [PRODUCT] to [PERSONA]:

**SITUATION** (understand current state)
- Open-ended questions about their setup
- Non-threatening, easy to answer
- Establishes baseline

**PROBLEM** (surface difficulties)
- Where current situation falls short
- Frustrations and inefficiencies
- Gaps between current and ideal

**IMPLICATION** (expand pain)
- Business impact of problems
- Cost of inaction
- Ripple effects

**NEED-PAYOFF** (envision solution)
- What would solving this enable?
- Value of improvement
- Buying vision

Give me 5 questions for each category, specific to [PRODUCT/PERSONA].
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Listen more than talk** — Aim for 70% them, 30% you
2. **Follow the pain** — When they mention a problem, dig deeper
3. **Quantify impact** — "What does that cost you?" makes pain concrete
4. **Don't pitch yet** — Discovery is for understanding, not selling
5. **Confirm understanding** — "So what I'm hearing is..."

## Red Flags to Watch For

```
After the call, check for these red flags:

- No clear pain (just "exploring")
- Won't discuss budget ("too early")
- Can't explain decision process
- No timeline or urgency
- Champion lacks authority
- Too many stakeholders
- Previous failed implementations
- Unrealistic expectations
```
