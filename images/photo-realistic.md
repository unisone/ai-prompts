# Photo-Realistic Image Prompts

> Generate convincingly realistic images with AI (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion).

## When to Use

- Product mockups and visualizations
- Stock photo alternatives
- Marketing materials
- Social media visuals
- Concept visualization

## Why It Works

Photo-realistic AI images require specific technical language that mimics photography. By including camera settings, lighting terminology, and compositional details, you guide the model toward realism rather than illustration.

## Style Modifiers

### To Increase Realism
```
Add to any prompt:
- "hyperrealistic"
- "photorealistic" 
- "8K resolution"
- "highly detailed"
- "shot on [specific camera]"
- "RAW photo"
- "unedited photograph"
```

### To Add Mood
```
- "moody atmosphere"
- "dramatic lighting"
- "cinematic color grading"
- "film grain texture"
- "soft and dreamy"
- "high contrast"
- "muted color palette"
```

### Negative Prompts (What to Avoid)
```
For most AI image generators, specify what NOT to include:

Negative prompt: cartoon, illustration, painting, drawing, 
art, sketch, anime, 3D render, CGI, artificial, fake, 
blurry, low quality, watermark, text, logo
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Be specific about camera/lens** — Creates consistent "look"
2. **Describe lighting precisely** — Most important realism factor
3. **Include texture details** — Skin texture, fabric weave, surface detail
4. **Reference real photographers** — "in the style of Annie Leibovitz"
5. **Use photography terminology** — DOF, bokeh, exposure, RAW

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Looks like CGI | Add film grain, reduce saturation |
| Weird hands/faces | Focus prompt on environment, crop subjects |
| Too perfect/sterile | Add "candid", "documentary", "imperfect" |
| Inconsistent lighting | Specify one light source clearly |
| Wrong aspect ratio | Include "portrait orientation" or "16:9" |

## Effectiveness

| Use Case | Realism Level |
|----------|---------------|
| Products | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Landscapes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Architecture | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Food | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| People (full body) | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Faces (close-up) | ⭐⭐ (still challenging) |
