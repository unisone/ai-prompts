# Anti-Botspeak Guide

> Avoid phrases that instantly flag your content as AI-generated.

## When to Use

- Writing content for public consumption
- Marketing copy, blog posts, social media
- Any text that needs to sound human
- Client deliverables

## Why It Works

AI models have patterns. Readers have learned to spot them. Using these "cursed phrases" immediately signals "a bot wrote this" — destroying credibility and engagement. This prompt helps you get human-sounding output.

## The Prompt

### Basic Anti-Botspeak

```
Write [YOUR REQUEST] in a natural, human voice.

AVOID these AI-sounding patterns:
- "Here's the kicker"
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's unpack this"
- "Here's the breakdown"
- "That's rare" / "And that matters"
- "It's not X, it's Y" (contrast framing)
- "You're allowed to..."
- Starting sentences with "And honestly?"
- Excessive emoji bullets (✅ ⭐ 🎯)
- Everything being "quiet" (quiet confidence, quiet truth)
- Therapist-speak ("You're not alone in feeling...")

Sound like a competent professional, not a LinkedIn influencer.
```

### Comprehensive Voice Guide

```
Write this in a genuine human voice. 

BANNED PHRASES (instant AI detection):
- "Here's the kicker" / "Here's the thing"
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's unpack this" / "Let's break this down"
- "And the best part?"
- "Here's what most people miss"
- "[X], and that matters"
- "That's rare"
- "You're not imagining it" / "You're not alone"
- "Do you want to sit with that?"
- "You're allowed to [permission-giving]"
- Forced depth ("Are you ready to go deeper?")
- Small caption formatting with labels everywhere
- Starting with "I" then immediately pivoting

INSTEAD:
- Be direct. Say what you mean.
- Use specific details over vague claims
- Vary sentence length naturally
- Have a point of view (not "on one hand... on the other")
- Sound like someone with experience, not someone performing expertise
```

## The Cursed Phrases List

### Instant Detection (Never Use)

| Phrase | Why It's Bad |
|--------|-------------|
| "Here's the kicker" | Classic GPT-ism |
| "Let's unpack this" | Overused transition |
| "That's rare" | Empty emphasis |
| "And that matters" | Appears in every AI response |
| "It's not X, it's Y" | Obvious contrast framing |
| "Here's the breakdown" | AI loves lists |
| "You're allowed to..." | Unsolicited permission |

### Structural Tells

| Pattern | Human Alternative |
|---------|------------------|

| **Bold** every **other** word | Bold only key terms |
| Tiny labeled sections | Let ideas flow naturally |

| Starting every paragraph same way | Mix it up |

### Therapist-Speak (Avoid)

- "That's valid"
- "I hear you"
- "Do you want to sit with that?"

### Hype Phrases (Avoid)

- "The hidden truth about..."

## Example

### Before (AI-Sounding)
```
Let's dive into productivity tips! Here's the thing — most people 
think it's about working harder. But here's the kicker: it's not 
about time, it's about energy. And that matters more than you think.

Here's the breakdown:
✅ Tip 1: Block your calendar
✅ Tip 2: Batch similar tasks  
✅ Tip 3: Take real breaks

You're allowed to rest. That's rare advice, but it's true.
```

### After (Human-Sounding)
```
Most productivity advice gets it backwards. They tell you to 
manage your time better when the real problem is energy management.

I've tried dozens of systems. Three things actually stuck:

Block your calendar ruthlessly. Not just meetings — block time 
for actual work. Treat it like an appointment with your most 
important client (you).

Batch similar tasks. Context-switching is expensive. Do all your 
emails at once, all your calls in a window, all your writing in 
a focused block.

Take breaks before you need them. By the time you feel burned out, 
you're already behind. Schedule rest like you schedule work.

None of this is revolutionary. But doing it consistently is rare.
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Read it aloud** — Does it sound like something you'd actually say?
2. **Remove the first sentence** — AI often starts with throat-clearing
3. **Cut filler words** — "Really", "very", "actually", "just"
4. **Add specific details** — Vague = AI, specific = human
5. **Have an opinion** — Wishy-washy = AI

## When to Skip

- Internal documentation (nobody cares)
- Technical specs (clarity > voice)
- When you're genuinely teaching (some "AI patterns" are just good teaching)
