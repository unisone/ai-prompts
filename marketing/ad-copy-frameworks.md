# Ad Copy Frameworks

> Write high-converting ad copy using proven direct response formulas.

## When to Use

- Facebook/Instagram ads
- Google Ads copy
- Landing page headlines
- Sales page copy
- Any paid promotional content

## Why It Works

Direct response copywriting has 100+ years of testing what makes people act. These frameworks encode that knowledge into repeatable patterns. They work because they're built on human psychology, not guesswork.

## The Prompt

### Multi-Framework Ad Generator

```
Create ad copy for:

**Product**: [Product/service name]
**Target Audience**: [Who you're selling to]
**Key Benefit**: [Main value proposition]
**Offer**: [What they get - discount, trial, bonus]
**Goal**: [Awareness/Traffic/Conversion]

Generate copy using these frameworks:

**1. AIDA** (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
**2. PAS** (Problem, Agitate, Solve)
**3. BAB** (Before, After, Bridge)
**4. 4Ps** (Picture, Promise, Prove, Push)
**5. QUEST** (Qualify, Understand, Educate, Stimulate, Transition)

For each framework:
- Headline (under 10 words)
- Body copy (50-80 words)
- CTA (action-oriented)

Then recommend which framework fits best for [platform/goal] and why.
```

### Facebook/Instagram Ad Copy

```
Write Facebook ad copy for:

**Product**: [Product]
**Audience**: [Demographics + psychographics]
**Pain Point**: [What problem you solve]
**Hook Style**: [Story/Question/Stat/Contrarian]

Create:
**Primary Text** (125 chars before "see more")
- Hook in first line
- Key benefit or pain point
- Social proof if relevant
- Clear CTA

**Headline** (40 chars)
- Benefit-focused
- Action-oriented

**Description** (30 chars)
- Supporting info or urgency

Create 3 variations with different angles.
```

## Core Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

```
Write PAS ad copy for [PRODUCT] targeting [AUDIENCE]:

**PROBLEM**: Name the pain they feel (in their words)
Example: "Spending hours on reports that nobody reads?"

**AGITATE**: Twist the knife — show implications
Example: "Meanwhile, your competition ships features while you push pixels in spreadsheets."

**SOLVE**: Introduce your solution as the answer
Example: "[Product] creates executive-ready reports in 5 minutes. Focus on work that matters."

Keep total copy under 100 words.
```

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

```
Write BAB ad copy for [PRODUCT] targeting [AUDIENCE]:

**BEFORE**: Paint the current painful state
Example: "You know the drill. Hours of coding, endless bugs, shipping at midnight."

**AFTER**: Paint the dream state
Example: "Imagine: clean code on the first try. Home by 6. Weekends actually free."

**BRIDGE**: Your product is how they get there
Example: "[Product] catches bugs before you do. 10x fewer late nights. Guaranteed."

Focus on emotional transformation, not features.
```

### 4Ps (Picture-Promise-Prove-Push)

```
Write 4Ps ad copy for [PRODUCT]:

**PICTURE**: Help them visualize the outcome
Example: "Picture this: Opening your laptop and knowing exactly what to work on."

**PROMISE**: State your bold claim
Example: "[Product] organizes your chaos into a clear daily action plan."

**PROVE**: Back it up
Example: "Used by 10,000+ professionals. 4.9 stars. 'Finally, a system that works' — Mike T."

**PUSH**: Drive action
Example: "Try it free for 14 days. No credit card. Start now →"
```

## Platform-Specific Templates

### Google Ads (Search)

```
Write Google Search ads for:

**Keyword**: [Target keyword]
**Product**: [What you're selling]
**USP**: [Unique selling proposition]

Create:
**Headline 1** (30 chars): Keyword inclusion
**Headline 2** (30 chars): Key benefit
**Headline 3** (30 chars): CTA or offer
**Description 1** (90 chars): Expand on benefit + credibility
**Description 2** (90 chars): Features + urgency

Create 3 ad variations for A/B testing.
```

### LinkedIn Ads

```
Write LinkedIn ad copy for B2B:

**Product**: [B2B product/service]
**Target**: [Job title, industry, company size]
**Goal**: [Lead gen/demo request/content download]

Tone: Professional but not boring. Credible, not salesy.

**Intro Text** (150 chars):
- Hook relevant to their role
- Business outcome focus

**Headline** (70 chars):
- Specific benefit

**CTA Button**: [Learn More/Sign Up/Download/Register]

Avoid: Hype, consumer-style copy, obvious selling.
```

## Headline Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| How to [result] without [pain] | "How to 10x Sales Without Cold Calling" |
| [Number] Ways to [benefit] | "7 Ways to Cut Meeting Time in Half" |
| The Secret to [desired outcome] | "The Secret to Landing Page Copy That Converts" |
| [Result] in [Timeframe] | "Fluent Spanish in 90 Days" |
| Warning: [Fear] | "Warning: Your Passwords Are Probably Compromised" |
| New [Product]: [Benefit] | "New Tool: Automate Your Invoicing in 5 Minutes" |
| Stop [Pain], Start [Benefit] | "Stop Guessing, Start Knowing What Customers Want" |

## CTA Optimization

```
Generate 10 CTA variations for:

**Action**: [What you want them to do]
**Offer**: [What they get]

Requirements:
- Action verbs (Get, Start, Claim, Discover)
- Benefit-oriented, not task-oriented
- Create urgency without being sleazy
- Match the offer value

Bad: "Submit" / "Click Here" / "Learn More"
Good: "Get My Free Guide" / "Start Saving Today" / "Claim Your Spot"
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Lead with benefit, not product** — They don't care about features
2. **One CTA per ad** — Multiple CTAs = no action
3. **Test headlines first** — Biggest lever for performance
4. **Use their words** — Mine reviews, forums, support tickets
5. **Urgency works** — But only if it's real

## Effectiveness

| Framework | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| PAS | Problem-aware audiences |
| BAB | Transformation products |
| AIDA | Cold audiences |
| 4Ps | High-ticket offers |
