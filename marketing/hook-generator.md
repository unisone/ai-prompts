# Hook Generator

> Create attention-grabbing hooks that stop the scroll.

## When to Use

- Social media posts
- Email subject lines and opening lines
- Video intros (YouTube, TikTok, Reels)
- Ad copy
- Blog post introductions

## Why It Works

You have 3 seconds to grab attention. Hooks work because they trigger psychological responses: curiosity gaps, pattern interrupts, social proof, and direct benefits. This prompt generates hooks using proven patterns.

## The Prompt

### Multi-Hook Generator

```
Create 10 hooks for content about: [TOPIC]

Use these proven patterns (at least one of each):

1. **Contrarian**: Challenge common belief
   "Stop doing X" / "X is a lie" / "Unpopular opinion:"

2. **Curiosity Gap**: Open a loop
   "The hidden reason..." / "What nobody tells you about..." / "I was wrong about..."

3. **Social Proof**: Borrow credibility  
   "How [successful person] achieved..." / "[Company] does this differently..."

4. **Direct Benefit**: Promise outcome
   "Get [result] in [timeframe]" / "The fastest way to..."

5. **Story Entry**: Pull into narrative
   "I lost $X learning this..." / "Last week, something happened..."

6. **Number/Stat**: Specific = credible
   "X% of people don't know..." / "I tested X methods. Here's what worked."

7. **Question**: Trigger internal response
   "What if everything you knew about X was wrong?" / "Why do successful people do X?"

8. **Fear/FOMO**: Loss aversion
   "The mistake that's costing you..." / "Before it's too late..."

9. **How-To Promise**: Clear value
   "How to X (without Y)" / "The exact process I used to..."

10. **Pattern Interrupt**: Unexpected
    "Forget everything you know about X" / "This is going to sound crazy, but..."

For each hook, explain why it works and which audience it's best for.
```

### Platform-Specific Hooks

```
Adapt this content hook for different platforms:

Core message: [YOUR MAIN POINT]

Generate hooks for:

**Twitter/X** (280 chars, text-first)
- Hook + thread promise
- Controversial take angle
- Thread format opener

**LinkedIn** (professional, insight-driven)
- Thought leadership angle
- Professional story entry
- Industry insight hook

**YouTube** (8-second retention window)
- Pattern interrupt opener
- Curiosity + payoff promise
- Stakes establishment

**TikTok/Reels** (1-second decision)
- Motion + text hook combo
- Trending format adaptation
- "Wait for it" setup

**Email Subject Line** (40 chars, inbox competition)
- Curiosity gap
- Direct benefit
- Personal/exclusive feel
```

## Example

### Topic: Productivity Tips

**Contrarian:**
"The productivity advice that's making you less productive"

**Curiosity Gap:**
"I spent 10 years optimizing my productivity. Then I discovered I was solving the wrong problem."

**Social Proof:**
"Elon Musk's actual daily schedule (it's not what you'd expect)"

**Direct Benefit:**
"Get 4 hours back every week with one system change"

**Story Entry:**
"I burned out twice before I figured this out."

**Number:**
"I tested 23 productivity systems. Only 3 actually worked."

**Question:**
"What if your todo list is the reason you're not getting things done?"

**Fear:**
"The hidden cost of 'staying busy' (it's not just time)"

**How-To:**
"How to finish your most important work by noon (without waking up earlier)"

**Pattern Interrupt:**
"Stop trying to be productive. Start trying to be effective."

## Advanced Patterns

### The "Wait, What?" Pattern

```
Create hooks that make people stop and re-read:

Topic: [TOPIC]

Requirements:
- Violates expectations
- Creates cognitive dissonance
- Makes them need the explanation

Example: "I doubled my income by working less" (violates work=money assumption)

Generate 5 "Wait, What?" hooks for [TOPIC].
```

### The Open Loop Pattern

```
Create hooks that MUST be closed:

Topic: [TOPIC]

The hook should:
- Promise specific insider information
- Create a knowledge gap
- Feel incomplete without reading more

Example: "There's one question I ask in every interview. It's eliminated 90% of hiring mistakes."

Reader NEEDS to know the question.

Generate 5 open loop hooks for [TOPIC].
```

### The Specificity Pattern

```
Make generic hooks specific:

Generic: "How to make money online"
Specific: "How I made $4,232 last month with a simple Notion template"

Take these generic hooks and make them specific:
- [Generic hook 1]
- [Generic hook 2]
- [Generic hook 3]

Specificity = credibility. Add numbers, timeframes, methods, or names.
```

## Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| How to [result] without [pain] | "How to lose weight without giving up food you love" |
| The [number] [things] that [result] | "The 3 words that double email response rates" |
| What [authority] knows about [topic] | "What Navy SEALs know about productivity" |
| I [did thing], here's what happened | "I tried X for 30 days, here's what happened" |
| Stop [common action] | "Stop checking email first thing" |
| [Unexpected thing] is [actually] | "Your todo list is actually a procrastination tool" |
| Why [surprising thing] | "Why waking up early won't make you successful" |

## Hook Testing Framework

```
I have these hooks for [CONTENT]:

1. [Hook 1]
2. [Hook 2]
3. [Hook 3]

Evaluate each on:
- Curiosity trigger (1-10)
- Relevance to target audience (1-10)
- Clickbait risk (1-10, lower is better)
- Deliverability (can the content actually deliver?)

Then rank them and explain your reasoning.
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Hook must match content** — Clickbait breaks trust
2. **Test multiple hooks** — Best one is rarely obvious
3. **Platform matters** — LinkedIn formal, Twitter casual
4. **Specificity wins** — Numbers beat vague claims
5. **One hook, one idea** — Don't overload

## Effectiveness
