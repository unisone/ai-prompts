# Content Repurposing Framework

> Turn one piece of content into 10+ assets across platforms.

## When to Use

- Maximizing ROI on content creation
- Building consistent cross-platform presence
- Creating content calendars efficiently
- Maintaining posting frequency without burnout

## Why It Works

Creating content from scratch is expensive. The best creators repurpose ruthlessly — one long-form piece becomes tweets, LinkedIn posts, email newsletters, short videos, and more. Same insights, different formats.

## The Prompt

### Full Repurposing Pipeline

```
Repurpose this content across platforms:

**Original Content**: [PASTE LONG-FORM CONTENT - blog, video transcript, podcast]

Create:

**Twitter/X Thread** (8-12 tweets)
- Hook tweet
- Key points as individual tweets
- Thread ender with CTA

**LinkedIn Post** (1 post)
- Professional angle on same topic
- Story or insight format
- 3-5 paragraph structure

**Email Newsletter Section** (200-300 words)
- Personal take on the topic
- One actionable tip
- Segue to CTA

**Short-Form Video Script** (60 sec)
- Hook (first 3 seconds)
- 3 quick points
- Punchy ending

**Quote Graphics** (3-5)
- Standalone quotes that work as images
- Keep under 15 words each

**Carousel Post** (Instagram/LinkedIn, 8-10 slides)
- Cover slide hook
- One idea per slide
- Final CTA slide

For each format, adapt the tone and style to match the platform.
```

### Single-Platform Deep Repurposing

```
Take this content and create a week's worth of posts for [PLATFORM]:

**Original**: [CONTENT]

Create:
- **Monday**: Main insight post
- **Tuesday**: Contrarian take on same topic  
- **Wednesday**: Quick tip/tactical post
- **Thursday**: Personal story related to topic
- **Friday**: Question/engagement post
- **Saturday**: Behind-the-scenes or process post
- **Sunday**: Curated/roundup post

Each should stand alone while reinforcing the core message.
```

## Example

### Original: Blog Post About Remote Work

**Twitter Thread:**
```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
"After 5 years of remote work, I've learned most advice is backwards.

A thread on what actually matters: 🧵"

Tweet 2: "Forget 'work-life balance.' That implies they're opposites. What you need is work-life integration."

Tweet 3: "The #1 predictor of remote work success isn't discipline. It's having a dedicated workspace. Even if it's a corner of a room."

[Continue thread...]

Final: "TL;DR: Remote work isn't about location. It's about intentional design of your work and environment. Took me 5 years to learn this."
```

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
5 years ago, I went fully remote.

I thought the challenge would be discipline.
I was wrong.

The real challenges:
→ Loneliness (solved: scheduled social time)
→ Context switching (solved: theme days)  
→ Never "leaving" work (solved: shutdown ritual)

The biggest surprise?

I'm more productive, not less. But not because of the obvious reasons (no commute, flexible hours).

It's because remote forces you to be intentional about everything.

That intentionality is the real skill.

What's been your biggest remote work lesson?
```

**Quote Graphics:**
```
1. "Remote work isn't about location. It's about intentional design."

2. "The opposite of loneliness isn't interaction. It's scheduled social time."

3. "You don't need work-life balance. You need work-life integration."
```

### Repurposing from Video/Podcast

```
Here's a transcript from my [video/podcast]:

[PASTE TRANSCRIPT]

Extract and create:

**Key Moments** (timestamps if available)
- Quotable moments
- Controversial takes
- Actionable tips

**Short Clips** (3-5 suggested cuts)
- Description of what to clip
- Hook for each clip
- Caption copy

**Written Derivatives**
- Blog post outline from the content
- Twitter thread
- LinkedIn post

**Engagement Content**
- Poll questions from the topics
- "What do you think?" posts
- Fill-in-the-blank engagement posts
```

## Content Atomization Framework

```
Atomize this long-form content into its smallest valuable units:

[PASTE CONTENT]

Extract:
- **Stats/Numbers**: Specific data points that stand alone
- **Quotes**: Memorable one-liners
- **Tips**: Actionable advice
- **Stories**: Anecdotes that work independently
- **Frameworks**: Mental models or processes
- **Contrarian Takes**: Unexpected perspectives
- **Questions**: Thought-provoking queries

For each atom, suggest 2-3 ways to use it (platform + format).
```

## Platform Adaptation Guide

| Platform | Tone | Format | Length |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Twitter/X | Casual, punchy | Threads, hot takes | 280 char / thread |
| LinkedIn | Professional, insightful | Stories, lessons | 1300 char |
| Instagram | Visual, aspirational | Carousels, reels | 2200 char caption |
| YouTube | Educational, personality | Long-form, shorts | Varies |
| TikTok | Authentic, quick | Trends, tutorials | 60 sec ideal |
| Newsletter | Personal, valuable | Essays, curated | 500-1000 words |

## Pro Tips

1. **Create repurposing in batches** — One long-form piece → one repurposing session
2. **Adapt, don't just copy** — Each platform has its culture
3. **Schedule strategically** — Space out repurposed content
4. **Track what works** — Some formats will outperform
5. **Start with the platform that matters most** — Then adapt down

## Effectiveness
